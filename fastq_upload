### md5checksum and file size reports for when fastq data are first uploaded.

### Assume fastq metadata already shared
#### Before importing fastq files, check the files that will be imported match exactly to names in the uploaded metadata

### (Jim needs to check the file names match up)

### generate md5sum and store it so when we move things around we can check for corruption

### at least check that the foward and reverse read files are the same length
This script is located here: https://github.com/CALeDNA/eDNA_Explorer/blob/main/fastq_upload.R

## Jim will need to design a way to communicate to the user that the files have issues and need to be checked and reuploaded if the line numbers for R1 and R2 fastqs are not equivalent.
