### Assume fastq metadata already shared
#### Before importing fastq files, check the files that will be imported match exactly to names in the uploaded metadata

### (Jim needs to check the file names match up)

### generate md5sum and store it so when we move things around we can check for corruption

### at least check that the foward and reverse read files are the same length

#option 1
ls *gz > list.txt
while read name;
do
  zcat $name | echo $((`wc -l`/4)) > filelines.txt
done < list.txt

#option 2
for i in *.fastq.gz; do echo "$i" $(gunzip -c $i | echo `wc -l`/4 | bc -l); done

# checks that the forward and reverse files are the same.

## Jim will need to design a way to communicate to the user that the files have issues and need to be checked and reuploaded if the line numbers for R1 and R2 fastqs are not equivalent.
